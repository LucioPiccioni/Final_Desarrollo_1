# **Stellar Jump - Final Project for Development I**

This project is the final assignment for the **Development I** course, developed in **C++** using the **raylib** graphics library. It is a game inspired by **Doodle Jump**, but set in space, featuring unique mechanics that offer an exciting challenge.

## **Main Features**  
- **Space Theme:** Jump between platforms in a cosmic environment full of movement and dynamism.  
- **Dynamic Platforms:** Platforms constantly descend and move horizontally, adding an extra level of difficulty.  
- **Graphics with raylib:** The game uses the raylib graphics library to deliver a simple yet effective visual experience.  
- **Scoring Mechanics:** Earn points by surviving longer and achieving your highest score.

## **System Requirements**  
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
